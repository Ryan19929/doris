/**
 * The lineage of the data in a partition that was written by a RESTORE job.
 *
 * <p>It records which backup the partition data came from: the partition in the source cluster
 * (db id, table id, partition id), the version the partition was restored to (which is the
 * visible version of the source partition when the backup was taken), the commit seq of the
 * source table when the backup was taken, the backup time, and the time the restore job committed.
 *
 * <p>It is always rebuilt from the {@code BackupJobInfo} of the restore job that writes it, and is
 * never inherited from the backup meta: the backup meta is a deep copy of the source table, so it
 * carries the lineage of the source partitions, which describes the source's own upstream.
 *
 * <p>The object is immutable. The serialized names are part of the persisted metadata and must
 * not be changed.
