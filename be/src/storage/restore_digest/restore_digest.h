// Order-independent logical digest of a tablet at a fixed version (0, V].
//
// algo_version = 1:
//   * Every visible row is encoded into a canonical byte string. For each digest column, in
//     schema order, one null-flag byte is written (0x00 = NULL, 0x01 = not NULL), followed by the
//     value if it is not NULL:
//       BOOLEAN/TINYINT/SMALLINT/INT/BIGINT/LARGEINT: native width, little endian
//       FLOAT/DOUBLE: raw IEEE-754 bits (no normalization of -0 / NaN payload)
//       DECIMAL32/64/128I/256: the unscaled integer at native width, little endian; precision and
//                              scale come from the schema signature, not from the row
//       DATEV2/DATETIMEV2: raw u32/u64 bit pattern; scale comes from the schema signature
//       IPV4/IPV6: u32/u128, little endian
//       CHAR: trailing '\0' padding stripped, then u32 length + bytes
//       VARCHAR/STRING/JSONB: u32 length + bytes (JSONB: the stored binary, byte for byte)
//     Types added after the first cut (they do not change the encoding of any type above, so
//     algo_version stays 1):
//       DECIMALV2: the in-memory int128 (value * 10^9), little endian; precision / scale are in
//                  the schema signature
//       DATE (v1): year u16, month u8, day u8 (fields, never the packed bits)
//       DATETIME (v1): year u16, month u8, day u8, hour u8, minute u8, second u8
//       ARRAY: u64 element count, then per element a null flag byte and the element encoding
//       MAP: u64 entry count, then per entry (key, value), each with a null flag byte, in the
//            stored order (the entries are not sorted)
//       STRUCT: per field in declaration order a null flag byte and the field encoding
//   * The row bytes are hashed with XXH3-128 (seed = algo_version). The high 8 bits of the high
//     64-bit half pick one of 256 buckets; a bucket keeps the sum (mod 2^128) of the row hashes
//     and its row count.
//   * root = SHA-256 over a fixed header and all 256 (sum, count) pairs.
//   * schema_sig = SHA-256 over the keys type and the (type, precision, scale) of every digest
//     column. Two digests are comparable only if algo_version and schema_sig are equal.
//
// Hidden columns: the delete sign is only used to filter rows (MoW and MoR), the sequence column
// takes part in the digest, version / commit TSO / skip bitmap / row store columns are excluded.
//
// Which rows are visible:
//   * Duplicate: every row, minus the rows removed by DELETE conditions (delete predicates) of
//     version <= V. A condition of version d removes matching rows of rowsets with end version < d,
//     the same rule the query path uses, so the digest is the same before and after a compaction
//     has physically dropped those rows.
//   * Unique MoW: the rows the delete bitmap snapshot at V leaves, minus delete-sign rows, minus
//     delete predicates. No merge is needed.
//   * Unique MoR: rows are merged across rowsets by key (highest version wins, sequence column
//     first when the table has one) by the same BlockReader the checksum task uses, then
//     delete-sign rows are dropped.
